# Noise_Beer_Pier
This is a collaboration project between Shae and Lily. This project was presented at Association for Research in Otolaryngology.
In this project, we investigate the effect of the signal-to-noise ratio on the perception of acoustic cues such as VOT(voice onset time).
In addition, we also explore how these effects play out in older listeners vs. younger listeners.
